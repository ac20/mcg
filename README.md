##Multiscale Combinatorial Grouping with Power Spectral Clustering

This repo consists of code to use MCG along with Power Spectral Clustering [article](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01516649v2/document) instead of Normalized Cut.

#Notes from original repository
MCG is the package code that implements the algorithms presented in:
 - Pont-Tuset J, Arbelaez P, Barron J, Marques F, Malik J,
 "Multiscale Combinatorial Grouping for Image Segmentation and Object Proposal Generation,"
 TPAMI 2016.

 - Arbelaez P, Pont-Tuset J, Barron J, Marques F, Malik J,
 "Multiscale Combinatorial Grouping,"
 CVPR 2014.

Please consider citing the papers if you use this code.

**CAUTION**

The **'full' package is not completely up to date**, use it only if you need to re-train the Pareto front or the ranking in MCG, then use 'pre-trained' to do the actual computations.

**'Full' and 'Pre-Trained' packages not compatible with Windows.**
